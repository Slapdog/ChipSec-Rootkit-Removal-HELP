# ChipSec-Rootkit-Removal-HELP
Vault7 Rootkit Suspect - VBIOS hacked, malware infested laptop legacy devices harbor embedded code, new installs get hijacked and emulated, all research points points me to Github using the ChipSec module provided by Intel. Problem is: I am not familiar with coding or command line at this level without guidance. Would like to learn as I go along, any help would be appreciated and the experience would surely add to my skillset. 
I will provide a logsheet of infected device peripherals as soon as possible. 
If a simple resolution exist please advise.
